  credits: '3'
  description: Introduces and explores the "Computational style of thinking" and its
    influence in science, mathematics, engineering and the arts. The course does not
    focus on the nuts and bolts of any particular programming language, but rather
    on the way in which computing has affected human culture and thought in the past
    half century. Same as ATLS 1240.

  credits: '3'
  description: |-
    This Social Computing class at the University of Colorado Boulder tackles the topic of “on-line sociality.” The course will examine online behaviors as they are exhibited on the social web and other social computing platforms. This has been historically called “computer mediated communication” or CMC. We will examine how CMC has evolved to what we know today as both social and technical (“socio-technical”) phenomena.

    The course will aggressively survey a range of social computing platforms and issues, while also diving deeply into two major platforms of study for which we have recognized expertise at the University of Colorado Boulder: Twitter and OpenStreetMap.  We will bring brand-new research results to the course by reviewing brand new papers from the international research community--many of which are still in “to appear” status--and attempt to duplicate and extend those results in projects. We will examine theories that describe on-line behavior, and consider how design features of social computing platforms and the circumstances in which they are used create different forms of on-line sociality.
