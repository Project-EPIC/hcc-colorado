  teaser: Prof. Anderson is interested in identifying the best techniques and components
    for developing large-scale software infrastructure. In his SPLASH'12 paper with
    Ph.D. student, Aaron Schram, he identifies some of the conceptual and implementation
    issues that are encountered when integrating NoSQL technology into an existing
    large-scale data collection infrastructure.

    Leysia Palen is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, USA. She is a faculty fellow with the ATLAS Institute and the Institute of Cognitive Science. She is also a Full Adjunct Professor at the University of Agder in Norway.

    Prof. Palen is a leader in the area of crisis informatics, an area she forged with her graduate students and colleagues at Colorado. She brings her training in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work and social computing to bear on understanding and advancing socio-technical issues of societal import. She conducts empirical research in the interpretivist tradition. However, in the advancing arena of large-scale on-line interaction (the "big data" of crisis response), she adapts quantitative techniques that then allow the application of qualitative methods and the "ethnographic eye" to closely observe and describe social structures in such technology-mediated situations.
