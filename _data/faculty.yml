  teaser: Prof. Anderson is interested in identifying the best techniques and components
    for developing large-scale software infrastructure. In his SPLASH'12 paper with
    Ph.D. student, Aaron Schram, he identifies some of the conceptual and implementation
    issues that are encountered when integrating NoSQL technology into an existing
    large-scale data collection infrastructure.

  url: https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/
  interests: HCI, CSCW, social computing, crisis informatics, ethnographic methods,
    computer meditated communication, social computing
  lab: Project EPIC, Center for Software and Society
  teaser: Prof. Palen is a leader in the area of crisis informatics, an area she forged
    with her graduate students and colleagues at Colorado. She brings her training
    in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work and social
    computing to bear on understanding and advancing socio-technical issues of societal
    import. She conducts empirical research in the interpretivist tradition. However,
    in the advancing arena of large-scale on-line interaction (the "big data" of crisis
    response), she adapts quantitative techniques that then allow the application
    of qualitative methods and the "ethnographic eye" to closely observe and describe
    social structures in such technology-mediated situations.
