  bio: 'Kyu Han Koh is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science
    at the University of Colorado at Boulder. His research interests focus on data
    analytics in education, specifically on improving the quality of a student learning
    from two complementary perspectives. One perspective is measuring a student’s
    learning performance and providing feedback to students and teachers. The other
    perspective is enhancing students’ learning experience and their measured learning
    performance through cognitivism, constructivism, and connectivism. Dr. Koh has
    compiled extensive research records on educational data analytics: knowledge transfer
    between game and simulation design, creativity analysis, skill progression and
    learning performance in programming. He received his B.S. in Computer Science
    from Soongsil University in South Korea in 2004, his M.S. in Computer Science
    from Auburn University in 2007, and his PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive
    Science from University of Colorado at Boulder in 2014. '
