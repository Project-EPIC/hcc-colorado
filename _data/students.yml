  advisor: Nikolaus Correll
  lab: Correll Lab
  goals: I am a 4th year Computer Science doctoral student in the Correll Robotics
    Lab at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I came to CU from Georgia Tech where
    I received my MS in Industrial Design. Much of my time at Tech was spent infiltrating
    the Computer Science Labs where I hopped on interactive technology projects of
    all shapes and sizes. I have a keen interest in Human Computer Interaction, mobile
    and ubiquitous computing, and novel sensing, with a specific focus on how wearable
    and embedded technologyÂ can be used for assistive purposes to help improve one's
    standard of living. Prior to my graduate work, I attended the University of Miami
    where I studied Management Science.
