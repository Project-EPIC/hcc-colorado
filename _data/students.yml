  goals: Software Engineering PhD student developing applications and tools to collect
    and analyze large amounts of social media streams to aid in discovery and response
    of mass emergencies. Primary research focuses on data collection and analysis
    techniques from disparate data sources. The resulting developed and deployed applications
    and frameworks heavily leverage Spring, Apache Cassandra, Lucene and Hadoop.

  goals: I am a 4th year Computer Science doctoral student in the Correll Robotics
    Lab at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I came to CU from Georgia Tech where
    I received my MS in Industrial Design. Much of my time at Tech was spent infiltrating
    the Computer Science Labs where I hopped on interactive technology projects of
    all shapes and sizes. I have a keen interest in Human Computer Interaction, mobile
    and ubiquitous computing, and novel sensing, with a specific focus on how wearable
    and embedded technologyÂ can be used for assistive purposes to help improve one's
    standard of living. Prior to my graduate work, I attended the University of Miami
    where I studied Management Science.
