Supports students in developing professional skills and practices in human computer interaction, design of interactive systems, computer supported cooperative work, computer supported collaborative learning, educational technology, tools that support creativity, user-developed knowledge collections, and gaming. May be repeated up to 10 total credit hours. Same as ATLS 3112.

CSCI 3308  (3). Software Engineering Methods and Tools
Focuses on software engineering methods and tools for application development, including design and system organization; using and creating reusable libraries; building, testing, and debugging; and performance evaluation. Two hours of lecture, two hours of lab per week.

CSCI 3702  (3). Cognitive Science
Introduces cognitive science, drawing from psychology, philosophy, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and linguistics. Studies the linguistic relativity hypothesis, consciousness, categorization, linguistic rules, the mind-body problem, nature versus nurture, conceptual structure and metaphor, logic/problem solving, and judgment. Emphasizes the nature, implications, and limitations of the computational model of mind.

CSCI 4143  (2). Principles of Telecommunications Policy
Learn the key issues and principles that guide the decisions of policymakers with respect to the regulatory treatment of voice, video, and data communications. Engage in critical debate, and develop instincts for anticipating the likely regulatory models that may be applied to new technologies. This introductory course covers technical, economic, legal, political, and institutional considerations. Same as TLEN 5210.

CSCI 4229  (3). Computer Graphics
Studies design, analysis, and implementation of computer graphics techniques. Topics include interactive techniques, 2D and 3D viewing, clipping, segmentation, translation, rotation, and projection. Also involves removal of hidden edges, shading, and color.

CSCI 4312   (3). Medical Informatics
Teaches students essential skills necessary for developing usable assistive and performance support systems, which include consideration of the academic and professional interdisciplinary issues that govern the work. An overview of ongoing and emerging topics in medical informatics will be presented.

CSCI 4322  (3). Things That Think
Introduces techniques of designing, constructing, and documenting computationally-enhanced physical artifacts. Students will work in teams and use state-of-the-art fabrication tools, microprocessors, and software systems to build working prototypes of objects that can be controlled and customized through embedded computation.

CSCI 4332  (3). Game Programming 

CSCI 4342  (3). Groupware and Workflow Systems
Supports students in developing professional skills and knowledge concerning the use of computer technologies to support collaborative activities. Also covers the impact of digital collaboration technologies on users, groups, organizations and society. Students will gain practical experience with Business Process Management and the use of Workflow Management Systems.

CSCI 4412  (3). Design, Creativity and New Media
Explores the design of new media and technologies to support design and creativity. Analyzes design and creativity as human activities of fundamental importance in the networked information culture and economy. Provides theoretical and practical analysis of new media. Prerequisites:Consent of instructor.

CSCI 4809  (3). Computer Animation
Develops a firm understanding of the general principles of computer animation and provides rigorous, hands-on training in the application of animation principles. Includes the creation of models, materials, textures, surfaces, and lighting. Introduces path and keyframe animation, particle dynamics, and rendering.

CSCI 4839  (3). User Centered Design
Develops the skills and practices necessary to apply user-centered approaches to software requirements analysis and the design and evaluation of computer applications.
